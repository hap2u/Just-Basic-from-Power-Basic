# Just-Basic from-Power-Basic
Creating a translator to turn Power Basic code into Just Basic/Liberty Basic.
In the past we have created translation programs which worked somewhat. 
Going back over these old programs, we picked out some of the methods and used them here.
The methods whiched which did many things at once created some bugs.
Noticed that placing spaces arround all operators and definers improved the search and replacement of old code.
Further executing one change or set of changes at a time, then saving the changes, allowed small problems as encountered to be fixed manually.
