# Just-Basic-from-Power-Basic
Creating a translator to turn Power Basic code into Just Basic/Liberty Basic.
In the past I have created translation programs which worked somewhat. 
I went back over some of these old programs picking out the best ideas and using them here.
First I remember how doing too many things at once created more problems than it solved.
Noticed that placing spaces arround all operators and definers improved the search and replacement of old code.
Doing one change or set of changes at a time when saved then opened for next changes allows small problems to be fixed manually as they are noticed.
