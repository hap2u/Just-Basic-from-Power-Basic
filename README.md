# Just-Basic from-Power-Basic
Attempting to Create a translator to turn Power Basic code into Just Basic/Liberty Basic Code.
In the past we have created translation programs which worked somewhat. 
Going back over these old programs, we picked out some of the methods and used them here.
The methods which did many things at once created some bugs.
Noticed from past methods, that placing spaces around all operators and definers, improved the search and replacement of old code.
Further executing one change or set of changes at a time, then saving the translated code, allowed small problems to be fixed manually.
Lastly the above methods enabled one with the use of controlling text files, to add or move translation sections as needed.
So if one discovered B needed to be done before A, it was easy using cut and paste to make this change.
